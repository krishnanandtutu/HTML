        The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being
         "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage".
          It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. 
          The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6 million visitors a year,[3] and in 2007 it was declared 
          a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000â€“2007) initiative.
